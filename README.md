### Final Exercise

Healthcare commissioners in Shropshire are considering a reconfiguration of maternity services. They wish to understand the current provision of antenatal scans.

They have provided you with a dataset, antenatal_scans.csv, and have initially asked these questions:

1. Do the "rural" locations (Bridgnorth, Robert Jones) serve older mothers? 

1. How many Shropshire registered patients go to sites outside Shropshire?

  (We'd also like to see flows inside shropshire, as well). 
  
#### Your task is to answer these question using the R and packages in the tidyverse suite.

We will also demonstrate an R connection to SQL server, an R output to PowerPoint, and (if time) a map produced with ggplot.
